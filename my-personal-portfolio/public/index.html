                <p>My professional journey began as an intern at Amperino Automotive and continued 
                    as a full-time job. During the 1.5 years I spent there, I actively contributed 
                    to projects within the company and worked on in-vehicle software and management systems.
                    I developed driver interfaces and digital instrument panels using C++/QT, and created
                    data processing systems that process raw data from CANBus using Python, enabling anomaly
                    detection and interactive visualization. Additionally, I managed and led the development
                    of the <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KbNQSHvnZH2m2zhHIO0NP_C8NIen8Bgq/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank" class="link-toolbox">ToolBox</a> application, which provides live data streaming and remote vehicle updates
                    based on Amazon Web Services (AWS); during this process, I took responsibility for both
                    the front end (QML/PySide) and the cloud/data layer (boto3, DynamoDB). Within the team, 
                    I gained end-to-end experience from prototyping to testing, simulation to field data.</p>

                    <p>In this project, I set up an end-to-end lightweight IoT communication infrastructure using the MQTT protocol
                        and Mosquitto broker. I wrote my own MqSystem class based on Qt's QMqttClient class; I implemented APIs such
                        as connectBroker, disconnectBroker, pub, sub, unsub, and managed all message flows in an event-driven manner
                        using the C++ signal-slot architecture. I conducted tests from broker setup (Mosquitto + Mosquitto clients) to
                        message publishing/subscription; I designed the structure/flow to process and log incoming messages. I later used
                        this basic infrastructure for Wi-Fi and Bluetooth-based data transfer and device integration‚Äîin other words, I am
                        the person who both set up the system and integrated it into the project and deployed it in the field..</p>

                        to independently carry out their daily tasks in the city. Users scan a QR code at their institution or social
                        space to be matched with a certified assistant, who helps them complete their tasks quickly and safely.
                        Staff members are registered and verified within the system and provide services in exchange for a small fee.
                        This approach not only supports individuals with disabilities but also strengthens the culture of mutual aid

                Based on this idea, I developed the ILTeach project, in which I turned artificial intelligence into a learning companion
                that explains topics just like a friend would. During the hackathon, I explained the technical details of the system I
                designed from scratch and the learning experience.</p>

                <h3>My First Step to the Cloud: Real-Time Data Uploading with AWS + Python</h3>
                <div class="blog-date">10 July 2024</div>
                <p>I took my first step into the cloud world by adding AWS support to a desktop application. Using the DynamoDB database,
                    the boto3 library, and Python, I set up a system that uploads my data to the cloud every 5 seconds.
                    I explained step by step how to set up this structure, which automatically creates tables, reads parameters from a file,
                    and updates data in real time.</p>

                <div class="blog-date">19 April 2024</div>
                <p>In this article, I explained how I built an IoT structure from scratch: Mosquitto broker setup, the MqSystem
                    class I built on the C++ side with QMqttClient, methods for testing publish/subscribe flows, and my approach to
                    data storage with MongoDB. I also show how I managed messages within the application using signals and slots in
                    this basic system with sample code snippets.</p>

                <h3>Easy Dependency Management in Python Projects: Requirement File</h3>
                <div class="blog-date">26 April 2024</div>
                <p>Instead of installing the libraries you use in Python projects one by one, you can install them all with a single command!
                    With the Requirements file, you can list all the dependencies in the project and quickly install them with the
                    pip install -r command. In my article, I explained how to create this file and how it can make your projects easier.</p>
