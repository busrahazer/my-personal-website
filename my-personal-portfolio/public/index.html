                <p>My professional journey began as an intern at Amperino Automotive and continued 
                    as a full-time job. During the 1.5 years I spent there, I actively contributed 
                    to projects within the company and worked on in-vehicle software and management systems.
                    I developed driver interfaces and digital instrument panels using C++/QT, and created
                    data processing systems that process raw data from CANBus using Python, enabling anomaly
                    detection and interactive visualization. Additionally, I managed and led the development
                    of the <a href="https://medium.com/@busrahazer" target="_blank" class="link-toolbox">ToolBox</a> application, which provides live data streaming and remote vehicle updates
                    based on Amazon Web Services (AWS); during this process, I took responsibility for both
                    the front end (QML/PySide) and the cloud/data layer (boto3, DynamoDB). Within the team, 
                    I gained end-to-end experience from prototyping to testing, simulation to field data.</p>

                    <p>In this project, I set up an end-to-end lightweight IoT communication infrastructure using the MQTT protocol
                        and Mosquitto broker. I wrote my own MqSystem class based on Qt's QMqttClient class; I implemented APIs such
                        as connectBroker, disconnectBroker, pub, sub, unsub, and managed all message flows in an event-driven manner
                        using the C++ signal-slot architecture. I conducted tests from broker setup (Mosquitto + Mosquitto clients) to
                        message publishing/subscription; I designed the structure/flow to process and log incoming messages. I later used
                        this basic infrastructure for Wi-Fi and Bluetooth-based data transfer and device integration‚Äîin other words, I am
                        the person who both set up the system and integrated it into the project and deployed it in the field..</p>
